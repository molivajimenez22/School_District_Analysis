# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyize school district data to highlight student grades for math and reading, idenfity trends/insights and provide overall performance for each school. Data for ninth graders at Thomas High School was reviewed twice and recalculated to reflect more accurate findings.

## Results
The data for ninth graders at Thomas High School was ommitted from initial analysis. However, after the overall percentage went down, the student count to remove ninth graders was performed so that it would more accurately highlight Thomas High School performance.

## Summary
When reviewing the overall school summary, one is able to see that many factors are involved. Let's start by reviewing a snapshot of all schools, including the high and low performing schools. We will then drill down further. 

### School Summary & High Low Performing Schools

### Budget
One can see that Cabrera High School, the top performer with an overall 91% passing, recieved $68 less per student than the low performer, Johnson High School. One can infur then that student scores are not always tied to budget.

### School Size
Furthermore, when reviewing the school sizes, one can see that large schools are low performers. Based on overall passing scores, one would infur that students perform better in a small to medium size setting.

### School Type
Another variable to consider is the difference between passing percentange for District and Charter schools. Overall, the chart below shows that students at charter schools receive a difference of 50% in overall passing score compared to students in district schools.
